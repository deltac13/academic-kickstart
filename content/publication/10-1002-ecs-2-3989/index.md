abstract: The combination of continuing anthropogenic impact on ecosystems across
  the globe and the observation of catastrophic shifts in some systems has generated
  substantial interest in understanding and predicting ecological tipping points.
  The recent establishment and full operation of NEON has created an opportunity for
  researchers to access extensive datasets monitoring the composition and functioning
  of a wide range of ecosystems. These data may be uniquely effective for studying
  regime shifts and tipping points in ecological systems because of their long time
  horizon, spatial extent, and most importantly the coordinated monitoring of many
  biotic and abiotic components of focal ecosystems. The variety of these data can
  capture a range of potential community shifts while also monitoring an extensive
  set of environmental drivers. This combination is critical for assessing whether
  changes are a result of external forcings or internal dynamics. Here, we present
  an overview of regime shift dynamics; describe a variety of approaches to identify
  tipping points with data from time series, spatial patterns, or frequency distributions
  of community states across environmental conditions; and suggest a number of NEON
  data products that may be appropriate for such analyses.
